  ## Installation
  
  In the terminal use "npm i" to download required modules
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use the application use "npm start" in the terminal to start up the API server.

  There is no front end so you will have to use apps like Insomnia or Postman to be able to use the app. In the routes folder, I have given what routes to use for what and example JSONs to create users, thoughts and reactions. Also I have not provided any seed data so you will have to make the users, thoughts and reactions yourself.
